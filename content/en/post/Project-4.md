* Created a Bar Chart Race that shows the dead and infected numbers caused by Coronavirus in Brazil.
* With this project we can see that Sao Paulo has more cases all the time, and with that we can make a correlation because Sao Paulo had the first case in Brazil
* Data is coming from [Coronavirus Brasil](https://covid.saude.gov.br/)
