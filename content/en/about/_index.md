### Data Science and Financial Analytics are my passions.
____
 My name is Eric Dias Souza. I'm a developer who have been working in the data science field doing financial analytics for the last 1 year. And I have been work with RPA using UiPath and Automation AnyWhere for the last 2 years, automating consulting processes. And I've been working with OCR using ABBYY for the past 2 years, extracting specific fields from a document for the business rule.
 
 I transitioned into data science from a business and consulting background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost; there were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. But hopefully I start to learn Data Science using other countries languages and then I fall in love with Data Science.
